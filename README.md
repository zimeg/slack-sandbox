# Slack Sandbox

a repo for experimenting with and testing various APIs across various samples.

## Available Apps

at the moment, this is a simple repo with only a few experiments. that might
soon change, and hopefully this message will too... but until then, we have:

* [Slack Send Github Action][gh_action]: `.github/workflows`

each subdirectory will have more information on getting started and references
to related documentation. be warned that the apps might not make much sense.
